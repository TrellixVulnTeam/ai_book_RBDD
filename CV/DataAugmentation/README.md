# Data Augmentation

Data augmentation is a common technique to improve results and avoid overfitting.

Basically, many modern classifiers and extremely complex; they need a huge amount of data to properly learn.
Especially this is important for images and deep learning models.
This is the main reason that we use the data augmentation.

We can augment the data by transforming existing samples.
For example, we could shift, rotate, scale, distort, flip, change contrast in images.
Or, we could add noise to input features.
Also, we could modify frequency and speed of audio samples.
